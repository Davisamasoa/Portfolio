I've been studying programming for over 3 years and I work on the full development of websites and applications — from design to coding and deployment. I enjoy well-structured projects, with a focus on performance, organization, and a good user experience. Here in my portfolio, you'll find some of the projects I've worked on throughout my journey. Each one reflects a bit of what I've learned — and continue to learn. I'm always looking to grow, take on new challenges, and build solutions that truly make sense.",
