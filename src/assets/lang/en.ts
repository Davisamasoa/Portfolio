People would always tell me I'm a technology geek, because I was always sneaking up on cell phones or any electronic device. Well, a thing led to another and my passion for technology expanded, and ever since I can not see myself working in another field. Getting to know about programming simply felt right for me and my life. I hope we can work together soon!",
